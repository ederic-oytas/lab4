# Lab 4: Wall Following

## I. Learning Goals

- PID Controllers
- Driving the car autonomously via Wall Following

## II. Review of PID in the time domain

A PID controller is a way to maintain certain parameters of a system
around a specified set point. PID controllers are used in a variety of
applications requiring closed-loop control, such as in the VESC speed
controller on your car. 

The general equation for a PID controller in the time domain, as
discussed in lecture, is as follows: 

$$
u(t)=K_{p}e(t)+K_{i}\int_{0}^{t}e(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}+K_{d}\frac{d}{dt}(e(t))
$$ 

Here, $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$ are constants that determine how much
weight each of the three components (proportional, integral,
derivative) contribute to the control output $u(t)$. $u(t)$ in our
case is the steering angle we want the car to drive at. The error term
$e(t)$ is the difference between the set point and the parameter we
want to maintain around that set point. 

## III. Wall Following

In the context of our car, the desired distance to the wall should be
our set point for our controller, which means our error is the
difference between the desired and actual distance to the wall. This
raises an important question: how do we measure the distance to the
wall, and at what point in time? One option would simply be to
consider the distance to the right wall at the current time $t$ (let's
call it $D_t$). Let's consider a generic orientation of the car with
respect to the right wall and suppose the angle between the car's
x-axis and the axis in the direction along the wall is denoted by
$\alpha$. We will obtain two laser scans (distances) to the wall: 
one 90 degrees to the right of the car's x-axis (beam b in the
figure), and one (beam a) at an angle $\theta$ ( $0<\theta\leq70$
degrees) to the first beam. Suppose these two laser scans return
distances a and b, respectively.

*Figure 1: Distance and orientation of the car relative to the wall* 

Using the two distances $a$ and $b$ from the laser scan, the angle
$\theta$ between the laser scans, and some trigonometry, we can
express $\alpha$ as 

$$
\alpha=\mbox{tan}^{-1}\left(\frac{a\mbox{cos}(\theta)-b}{a\mbox{sin}(\theta)}\right)
$$ 

We can then express $D_t$ as 

$$ D_t=b\mbox{cos}(\alpha) $$

to get the current distance between the car and the right wall. What's
our error term $e(t)$, then? It's simply the difference between the
desired distance and actual distance! For example, if our desired
distance is 1 meter from the wall, then $e(t)$ becomes $1-D_t$. 
	
However, we have a problem on our hands. Remember that this is a race:
your car will be traveling at a high speed and therefore will have a
non-instantaneous response to whatever speed and servo control you
give to it. If we simply use the current distance to the wall, we
might end up turning too late, and the car may crash. Therefore, we
must look to the future and project the car ahead by a certain
lookahead distance (let's call it $L$). Our new distance $D_{t+1}$
will then be 

$$D_{t+1}=D_t+L\mbox{sin}(\alpha)$$

*Figure 2: Finding the future distance from the car to the wall*

We're almost there. Our control algorithm gives us a steering angle
for the VESC, but we would also like to slow the car down around
corners for safety. We can compute the speed in a step-like fashion
based on the steering angle, or equivalently the calculated error, so
that as the angle exceeds progressively larger amounts, the speed is
cut in discrete increments. For this lab, a good starting point for
the speed control algorithm is: 

- If the steering angle is between 0 degrees and 10 degrees, the car
  should drive at 1.5 meters per second. 
- If the steering angle is between 10 degrees and 20 degrees, the
  speed should be 1.0 meters per second. 
- Otherwise, the speed should be 0.5 meters per second.

So, in summary, here's what we need to do:

1. Obtain two laser scans (distances) a and b.
2. Use the distances a and b to calculate the angle $\alpha$ between
   the car's $x$-axis and the right wall. 
3. Use $\alpha$ to find the current distance $D_t$ to the car, and
   then $\alpha$ and $D_t$ to find the estimated future distance
   $D_{t+1}$ to the wall. 
4. Run $D_{t+1}$ through the PID algorithm described above to get a
   steering angle. 
5. Use the steering angle you computed in the previous step to compute
   a safe driving speed. 
6. Publish the steering angle and driving speed to the `/drive` topic
   in simulation. 

## IV. Implementation

Implement wall following to make the car drive autonomously around the
Levine Hall map. Follow the inner walls of Levine. Which means follow
left- make sure the the car is going counter-clockwise in the
loop. (The first race we run will be counter-clockwise). You can
implement this node in either C++ or Python. 

## V. Deliverables and Submission

**Deliverable 1**: After you're finished, update the entire skeleton
package directory with your team's `wall_follow` package and directly
commit and publish to GitHub. You will need to make sure the TA is
added as a collaborator. Your committed code should start and run in
simulation smoothly.The package should include a launch file that
allows students to change variables from the command line for the
following: 
- P, I, and D tuning variables
- Vehicle Speed

```bash
ros2 launch wall_follow_launch.py speed:=2.0 P:=2.0 I:=2.0 D:=2.0
```

**Demonstrations**: Students will be given 20 minutes each to demo in
class between two days. Teams will be asked to present in a round
robin fashion- in numerical order. If there remains any extra time
between implementations, the next group to present will be allowed to
start their 20 minute slot. Leftover teams will be allowed to present
in the same numerical order in whatever leftover time exists. 

**Simulator Demonstration**: Students will be required to demonstrate
their team's implementation in class on the specified evaluation
date. Students should have their implementations ready for
demonstration before their allotted time (simulator already pulled up,
teleop, etc.). Team's will test their implementation in the Levine
Hall (default) map. A successful demonstration includes: 


- The vehicle autonomously drives a lap, following the left wall,
  around the track without collision. 
- The vehicle can drive with imperceptible oscillations after turning
  the first corner. 
- The vehicle can successfully make it past the trap in the bottom of
  the simulator map. 

**On Vehicle Demonstration:** The presentation on vehicle will be held
in person on a track set up in the classroom. Students will have
whatever is remaining of their 20 minutes on vehicle to demo. The
vehicle will be expected to complete the following tasks: 
- The vehicle autonomously drives a lap, following the left wall,
  around the track without collision. 
- The vehicle can drive with imperceptible oscillations after turning
  the first corner. 
- The vehicle can successfully make it past traps located on the
  track.

## VII: Extras
Some things to note during implementation:

-  Continual terminal output delays node processing and may impact the
correct operation of the vehicle. 
Provide terminal output for the successful launching of the node and
no more. 

### Clamping
Clamping is used to control the calculated control output, *u(t)*,
which is to be considered the steering_angle. 
While testing, it is possible this number will quickly get out of hand
due to integral windup. Using a clamp 
will ensure *u(t)* is always within an acceptable range.
The most the steering_angle can turn is by 20 degrees, in both
directions. A negative steering_angle 
will turn your vehicle right, and a positive angle to the left. The
steering_angle is stored under the 
AckermannDrive in radians. Be sure to keep this in mind while
progressing through the lab. 

### The Trap
On the South facing side of the simulator map lays a rectangular
irregularity, illustrated below. This portion of the map is a trap. It
is used to test implementations and catch the vehicle within its 
confines. Due to the tight corners, it can be nearly impossible for
the vehicle to maneuver out once it has 
entered.
